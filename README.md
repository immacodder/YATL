# Yet Another Todo List

## Description

This is one of my portfolio projects that I create to get a job, because I'm poor :(
This project is very similiar to Todoist, but not a 1 to 1 copy, I'm gonna change some stuff that annoys me in Todoist and add feature if I feel like doing it

## To start a local server

```bash
# Start firebase emulators
npx firebase emulators:start

# if you want to also make data persist across restarts
npx firebase emulators:start --import=./firebase_emulators_data --export-on-exit
```

```bash
# Start a development server
npm start
```
